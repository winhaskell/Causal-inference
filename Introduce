Causal inference 

Causal inference is the process of determining the independent, actual effect of a particular phenomenon that is a component of a larger system.
The main difference between causal inference and inference of association is that causal inference analyzes the response of an effect variable 
when a cause of the effect variable is changed. The study of why things occur is called etiology, and can be described using the language of 
scientific causal notation. Causal inference is said to provide the evidence of causality theorized by causal reasoning.

Causal inference is widely studied across all sciences. Several innovations in the development and implementation of methodology designed
to determine causality have proliferated in recent decades. Causal inference remains especially difficult where experimentation is difficult 
or impossible, which is common throughout most sciences.




Causal reasoning

Causal reasoning is the process of identifying causality: the relationship between a cause and its effect. 
The study of causality extends from ancient philosophy to contemporary neuropsychology; assumptions about 
the nature of causality may be shown to be functions of a previous event preceding a later one. 
The first known protoscientific study of cause and effect occurred in Aristotle's Physics.
Causal inference is an example of causal reasoning.
